# Notebooks for the MIR course

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks organised in the way it is planned to be presented in the actual course.

As the course targets hands-on practice, for some of the tasks there are two versions available:

- A student version where some parts of the code is left for the student to fill in. These parts are marked with: "Your code starts here" .... "Your code ends here"

- The complete version (which includes one of the many possible implementations for the expected part)

As part of their course work, every students was expected to create a similar notebook. These notebooks are gathered under the 'studentNotebooks' folder here.

In addition, some tutorials by MTG researchers were also planned. Notebooks for the tutorials are located in 'tutorials_MTGresearchers'

However, free samples are a powerful thing - and this file, which anyone may use freely, was created by combining a little more then a half-dozen free samples cultivated from freewavesamples.com and the No Budget Orchestra.\r\n\r\nThis single timpani hit is a combination of: the timpani of an Emu Proteus 2, a Korg NS5R timpani (pitched one octave lower to C2), the timpani of an Alesis Fusion, the timpani of a Roland SC-88 (pitched one octave lower to C2), (all from FreeWaveSamples.com) and two timpani samples from the No Budget Orchestra, A2 and E2, each pitched down to C2. The result: this, a most singularly powerful timpani. In my opinion the results are most pleasing and I doubt one can find a timpani with more power and force then this for free."
